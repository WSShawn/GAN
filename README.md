# Generative Adversarial Networks

## Introduction and concept

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represent a class of Deep Learning Frameworks which have firstly been introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. While their spectrum of application is becoming larger with research, the main focus of GANs has been image processing.

The main idea behind GANs consists in the competition between 2 neural networks in a zero-sum game, the scope of each network being to improve its prediction accuracy. One network is named the "Generator" and the other the "Discriminator". The Generator's goal is to create fake data, with the ultimate goal of its output to be perceived as real. The goal of the Discrimnator is to look at the data generated by the Generator and label the data as "real" or "fake". As the data that the application of Generative Adversarial Networks is mainly focused on, as well as the data in our study is represented by images, we will focus on implementing Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs).

## Data 

The dataset used in our study is the Celeba Dataset. It represents a collection of more than 200K photos of celebrities, which come in .jpg format.
